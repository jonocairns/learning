# Learning

This is where I keep ideas and findings relevant to software design.

- [Caching](https://github.com/jonocairns/learning/blob/master/caching.md) - so far this is just a brief summary of a pattern of try-get-set. This is a cache getter function that takes in a key and a delegate. If the cache key value is not set it will perform the delegate and store the delegates result in the cache.

- [Common Cloud Application Setup](https://github.com/jonocairns/learning/blob/master/cloud.md) - This is some common architecture patterns I've seen in my experience that have worked quite well and work with a wide range of requirements.
